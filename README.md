# ddos-detection-using-timeseries

## Problem statement 
Detect DDOS attack in regular traffic 
owing through network by time series forecasting
of current traffic.Stochastic time series model like ARIMA and ANN time series model like
LSTM is used as machine learning models for this purpose.Best model will be deployed to
system after comparing the performance of models to recognize the attack situation.
